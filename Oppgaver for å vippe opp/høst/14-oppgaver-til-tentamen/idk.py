am an intermediate level Python programmer. This is my implementation of a MP3 Playlist class challenge that was hosted on 101 Computing.Net. The goal of the challenge was to implement a Class in Python to maintain an MP3 Playlist. The key features of the class are the ability to:

Enqueue an MP3 to the playlist
Remove an MP3 from the playlist
Load a playlist from a text file
Save a playlist on a text file
Shuffle all the songs in the playlist
Display all the tracks from the playlist
Count the number of tracks in the playlist
Calculate the total duration of the playlist
Empty/Reset the playlist
Check if the playlist is empty
